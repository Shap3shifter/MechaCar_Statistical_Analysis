## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In performing a linear regression about the MechaCar_mpg.csv file, we find that the following factors play an impact in the amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset:
- Vehicle Length
- Ground Clearance
These two factors provide enough of a positive slope and have a low enough significance level within our model such that our linear model is considered to have a non-zero positive slope. Vehicle length and Ground clearance have beta value of 6.267 and 3.546 respectively with a miniscule p-value for both variables.
The r^2 value about this regression model is .7149, which makes for a strong enough coefficient of determination r-value of .8455 that indicates this model makes a good approximation of real-world data points.
